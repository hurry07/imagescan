title: imagescan Source Code Archives
---

Source code archives for `imagescan` can be downloaded from the [EPSON
Download Center][EDC].  You select one of the supported models, pick
the driver you need from the list of search results, accept the terms
of a click-through license and locate what you are looking for in the
long list of downloadable files.  ... Or you just click on one of the
download buttons on the left.

Want to get an older version?  Good thing the source code archives are
maintained in a GitHub repository.  Just head over to the releases and
take your pick.

Want to make some changes to the code?  Just clone the repository and
help yourself.  Want to help your neighbours too?  Even better, but
please head over to the `utsushi` repository where patches and pull
requests are integrated.  The `imagescan` repository exists solely to
track the source code archives that are made available at the [EPSON
Download Center][EDC].  Nothing more, nothing less.

The `utsushi` project will fix `imagescan` website and repository
issues but will *not* modify the code beyond what changes between
releases of the source code archives.
