{"name":"Imagescan","tagline":"EPSON Download Center Source Code Archives","body":"# `imagescan` Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nSource code archives for `imagescan` can be downloaded from the [EPSON\r\nDownload Center][EDC].  You select one of the supported models, pick\r\nthe driver you need from the list of search results, accept the terms\r\nof a click-through license and locate what you are looking for in the\r\nlong list of downloadable files.  ...  Or you just click on one of the\r\ndownload buttons on the left.\r\n\r\nWant to get an older version?  Good thing the source code archives are\r\nmaintained in a GitHub repository.  Just head over to the releases and\r\ntake your pick.\r\n\r\nWant to make some changes to the code?  Just clone the repository and\r\nhelp yourself.  Want to help your neighbours too?  Even better, but\r\nplease head over to the `utsushi` repository where patches and pull\r\nrequests are integrated.  The `imagescan` repository exists solely to\r\ntrack the source code archives that are made available at the [EPSON\r\nDownload Center][EDC].  Nothing more, nothing less.\r\n\r\nThe `utsushi` project will fix `imagescan` website and repository\r\nissues but will *not* modify the code beyond what changes between\r\nreleases of the source code archives.\r\n\r\n[EDC]: http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/?OSC=LX","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
